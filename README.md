[the goal]
</br>\\\- visualize the [what] in, [what] out, [how] dataset are changed

[why]
</br>\\\- its one of main actor/with-life in the network

[what]
</br>\\\- an object which perform special operation in network 
</br>\\\--- softmax function or normalized exponential function. represent a categorical distribution, which is a probability distribution over K different possible outcomes

[use-case]
</br>\\\- the-mediator(the softmax function) is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output (the output layer) of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes
